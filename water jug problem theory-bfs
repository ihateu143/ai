Breadth First Search (BFS) :
This is a very different approach for traversing the graph nodes. The aim of BFS algorithm is to
traverse the graph as close as possible to the root node. Queue is used in the implementation of the
breadth first search. Let’s see how BFS traversal works with respect to the following graph:

If we do the breadth first traversal of the above graph and print the visited node as the output, it will
print the following output. “A B C D E F”. The BFS visits the nodes level by level, so it will start with
level 0 which is the root node, and then it moves to the next levels which are B, C and D, then the last
levels which are E and F.

WaterJug Problem Statement:
We are provided with two jugs: one having the capacity to hold 3 gallons of water
and the other has the capacity to hold 4 gallons of water. There is no other measuring
equipment available and the jugs also do not have any kind of marking on them. So, the
agent’s task here is to fill the 4-gallon jug with 2 gallons of water by using only these
two jugs and no other material. Initially, both our jugs are empty.
